# Feature-Rich Object Notation (progressing)

JSON, even BSON, only supports a few types of objects. FRON (`/fr ån/`), on the 
other hand, is meant to support as many types as it can, and be feature-rich, 
especially for data transmission scenarios like IPC, RPC, and data storage, to 
bring the closest experience on both I/O ends.

*FRON adopts basic JSON style, and is compatible with JSON/BSON/JSONC* 
*<small>(JSON with comments)</small> data.*

Currently these types in JavaScript are considered:

- `Array` Only literal in case of conflict.
- `Boolean` Both literal and compound type.
- `comment` JavaScript style comments `//` and `/* */`.
- `Date`
- `Error` As well as well other built-in errors.
- `Map`
- `null`
- `Number` Both literal and compound type.
- `Object` Only literal in case of conflict.
- `RegExp` Both literal and compound type (the compound notation is different 
    than the constructor, e.g. `RegExp({ source:"[a-z]", flags: "i" })`).
- `Set`
- `String` Both literal and compound type, and supports multi-line strings via 
    using backquotes as ES2015 suggested.
- `Symbol` Only supports symbols registered via `Symbol.for()`.
- `TypedArray` includes all typed arrays such as `Int8Array`, `Uint8Array`, etc.

There are also some special notations that used internally to support more 
complicated scenarios.

- `Reference` References to one of the nodes of the object, regardless of 
    circulation.

While in NodeJS, these types are also pre-registered for support.

- `Buffer`
- `AssertionError`

*If there are versions for other platforms, they may not include all these types*
*or presented in different forms. That said, those implementations should be*
*look-like the JavaScript version as much as they can and translate these types*
*to platform alternatives instead.*

Each of these types are translated to string notations (with the same JavaScript
syntax) like the following examples:

```javascript
/************************ Literal Types *************************/

// String
'single-quoted string'
"double-quoted string"
`string
in
multiple
lines`

// number
12345
1e+32
NaN
Infinity

// boolean
true
false

// RegExp
/[a-zA-Z0-9]/i

// null
null

// Comment
// single-line comment
/* inline comment */
/*
comment
in
multiple
lines
*/

// Object
{ hello: "world", "key with quotes": 12345 }

// Array
["Hello", "World!"]

/************************ Compound Types *************************/

// Date
Date("2018-12-10T03:21:29.015Z")

// Error
Error({ name: "Error", message: "something went wrong", stack: ... })

// Map
Map([["key1", "value1"], ["key2", "value2"]])

// Set
Set([1, 2, 3, 4])

// Symbol
Symbol("description")

// RegExp
RegExp({ source: "[a-zA-Z0-9]", flags: "i" })

// Reference
Reference("") // circular reference to the root object.
Reference("abc")
Reference("abc.def")
Reference("abc['d e f']")

// TypedArray
Int8Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Int16Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Int32Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Uint8Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Uint16Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Uint32Array([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

## API

### Stringify

```typescript
FRON.stringify(data: any, pretty?: boolean | string): string
```

Serializes the given `data` to a FRON string. The optional `pretty` argument is 
for generating well-formatted outlook, if set `true`, then use default indent 
with two spaces, otherwise set a customized string of spaces for preferred 
indentation. By default, stringified data will not contain any meaningless 
spaces, however when `pretty` is set, the result string will be well-structed 
with additional spaces.

### Parse

```typescript
FRON.parse(data: string): any
```

Parses the serialized FRON string to JavaScript object. By default, if meets 
unknown types, the parser will ignore the type notation and parse the data 
according to the closest type.

#### Example of Unknown Type

```javascript
var fronStr = `
{
    someData: Exception({ code: 1001, message: "something went wrong" })
}
`;
var data = FRON.parse(fronStr, true);

console.log(data);
// {
//   someData: {
//     code: 1001,
//     message: "something went wrong"
//   }
// }
```

### Register

```typescript
FRON.register<T>(
    type: string | FRONConstructor<T> | (new (...args: any[]) => any),
    proto?: string | FRONConstructor<T> | FRONEntry<T>
)
```

Registers a customized data type so that the stringifier and parser can identify
it.

#### Example of Register Type

```typescript
class Exception {
    code: number;
    message: string;

    toFRON(): { [key in this]: any } {
        return Object.assign({}, this};
    }

    fromFRON(data: { [key in this]: any }): Exception {
        return Object.assign(new Exception(), data));
    }
}

FRON.register(Exception);
// is equivalent to
FROM.register(Exception.name, Exception.prototype);

// now the previous FRON string can be parsed correctly
var fronStr = `
{
    someData: Exception({ code: 1001, message: "something went wrong" })
}
`;

var data = FRON.parse(fronStr);

console.log(data);
// {
//   someData: Exception {
//     code: 1001,
//     message: "something went wrong"
//   }
// }
```

**NOTE:** Syntax `Exception({ code: 1001, message: "something went wrong" })` 
only indicates type `Exception` contains data 
`{ code: 1001, message: "something went wrong" }`, it doesn't mean that the
constructor takes the data as its argument.

The third signature `FRON.register<T>(type: string, aliasOf: string)` allows the
user assigning a new type as alias to an existing type, this is very useful when
a different implementation uses a different name of type that based on that 
platform but can be handled with an existing approach. Typically, `Buffer` 
is considered as an alias of `Uint8Array` in NodeJS.

```javascript
// You don't have to do this, the toolkit already done that.
FRON.register("Buffer", "Unit8Array");
```
